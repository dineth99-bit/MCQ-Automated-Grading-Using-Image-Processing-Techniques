# MCQ-Automated-Grading-Using-Image-Processing-Techniques
This pROJECT presents the development and implementation of an Optical Mark Recognition 
(OMR) system designed to automate the grading of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) using a 
laptop's built-in webcam. The purpose of this research is to address the inefficiencies and inaccuracies 
associated with traditional manual grading methods by using advanced image processing techniques 
when conducting physical examinations. The system utilizes the powerful OpenCV and NumPy 
libraries for image processing and mathematical operations, ensuring precise and efficient analysis of 
MCQ answer sheets. The methodology involves capturing images of MCQ sheets through either a live 
webcam feed or static image files, which are then resized to a standard resolution. Key pre-processing 
steps include grayscale conversion, Gaussian blurring, and Canny edge detection to identify and 
analyse the marked answers. Advanced contour analysis is employed to detect the boundaries of the 
MCQ and answer boxes, followed by perspective transformation to flatten the image for detailed 
examination. The extracted answers are then compared against a predefined answer key to calculate 
scores, which are visually represented on the marked image. The findings demonstrate the system's 
accuracy and efficiency in grading MCQs, significantly reducing the time and effort required for 
manual grading. The system provides immediate feedback, highlighting correct answers in green and 
incorrect answers in red, along with the total score. The results are documented and saved, facilitating 
performance tracking and feedback. In conclusion, this OMR system offers a cost-effective and 
accessible solution for educational institutions, enhancing the grading process by providing 
immediate and reliable results. It supports educators by reducing administrative burdens and 
allowing more focus on teaching activities. This research contributes to modernizing educational 
assessments, promoting a more interactive and engaging learning environment.
